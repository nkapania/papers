abstract = {Researchers from multiple fields have sought to understand how sex moderates human social behavior. While over 50 years of research has revealed differences in cooperation behavior of males and females, the underlying neural correlates of these sex differences have not been explained. A missing and fundamental element of this puzzle is an understanding of how the sex composition of an interacting dyad influences the brain and behavior during cooperation. Using fNIRS-based hyperscanning in 111 same- and mixed-sex dyads, we identified significant behavioral and neural sex-related differences in association with a computer-based cooperation task. Dyads containing at least one male demonstrated significantly higher behavioral performance than female/female dyads. Individual males and females showed significant activation in the right frontopolar and right inferior prefrontal cortices, although this activation was greater in females compared to males. Female/female dyad's exhibited significant inter-brain coherence within the right temporal cortex, while significant coherence in male/male dyads occurred in the right inferior prefrontal cortex. Significant coherence was not observed in mixed-sex dyads. Finally, for same-sex dyads only, task-related inter-brain coherence was positively correlated with cooperation task performance. Our results highlight multiple important and previously undetected influences of sex on concurrent neural and behavioral signatures of cooperation.},

abstract = {This paper describes the efforts to evaluate pedestrian gap acceptance as part of a recent TCRP-NCHRP project. Pedestrian crossing data were collected at 42 study sites in seven states. From those sites, 45 pedestrian approaches had at least one crossing event where a pedestrian rejected at least one gap, and 11 of those approaches had at least 20 such cross- ing events. Focusing on the 11 approaches, researchers evaluated the gap-acceptance behavior of crossing pedestrians with a two-part analy- sis: behavioral analysis and statistical analysis. Behavioral analysis revealed that pedestrians did not always wait to cross the street when all lanes were completely clear; instead, they anticipated that the lanes would clear as they crossed and used a rolling gap to cross the street. Statistical analysis revealed that the 11 approaches had 85th percentile accepted gaps between 5.3 and 9.4 s, with a trend of increasing gap length as crossing distance increased. All the observed 85th percentile accepted gaps were less than the critical gap as defined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for a walking speed of 3.5 ft/s (1.1 m/s) at their respective sites; this indicates that if 3.5 ft/s (1.1 m/s) were used as the design criterion, it would be sufficient to serve at least 85{\%} of the observed pedestrians at the study sites.},

We model each pedestrian as making a discrete crossing choice by comparing the gaps between vehicles in traffic to an individual-specific ‘critical gap' that characterizes the individual's minimal acceptable gap. We propose both parametric and nonparametric approaches to estimate the distribution of critical gaps in the population of pedestrians. To estimate the model, we gather field data on crossing decisions and vehicle flows at three intersections in New Delhi. The estimates provide information about heterogeneity in critical gaps across pedestrians and intersections, and permit simulation of the effect of changes in traffic light sequences on pedestrian crossing behaviour and waiting times.

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a potentially disruptive yet beneficial change to our transportation system. This new technology has the potential to impact vehicle safety, congestion, and travel behavior. All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach {\$}2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly {\$}4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model to simulate non-signalized pedestrian
crosswalks. Principal scope is to develop a tool to be used by
decision-makers to evaluate the necessity of introducing a new crosswalk
and/or switching to a traffic light and estimate the potential benefits
of such a measure in terms of Level of Service. The model is based on
empirical evidence gained during an observation of a non-signalized
crosswalk. Pedestrian motion is simulated using a Cellular Automata
model which is capable to simulate pedestrian dynamics at low density
conditions, as observed in the considered scenario. Vehicles use a
continuous car following model inspired on Gipps equations in which
driver's reaction time is considered. Pedestrian's decision-making
process on crossing attempt and model parameters are directly obtained
from the analysis of pedestrian-vehicle interactions observed in
reality. The model developed employs small time steps, thus allowing the
consideration of different pedestrian speeds (intrinsically considering
pedestrians with reduced mobility, such as elderlies) and smoothly
reproducing car-pedestrian interactions. This aspect required the
definition of distinct behavioral rules for vehicles and pedestrians
that, in their dynamic interaction, implement an ad-hoc coordination
model. In order to validate the model, delays (or waiting times)
measured for both pedestrians and drivers were compared with simulated
values. Results show a good agreement between empirically obtained time
delay and values computed in the simulation.},

abstract = {The modelling and simulation of the interaction among vehicles and pedestrians during cross-walking is an open challenge for both research and practical computational solutions supporting urban/traffic decision makers and managers. The social cost of pedestrians' risky behaviour pushes the development of a new generation of computational models integrating analytical knowledge, data and experience about the complex dynamics occurring in pedestrian/vehicle interactions, which are not completely understood despite recent efforts. This paper presents the results of a significant data gathering campaign realised at an unsignalized zebra crossing. The selected area of the city of Milan (Italy) is characterised by a significant presence of elderly inhabitants and pedestrian-vehicle risky interactions, testified by a high number of accidents involving pedestrians in the past years. The results concern the analysis of: (i) vehicular and pedestrian traffic volumes; (ii) level of service; (iii) pedestrian-vehicle interactions, considering the impact of ageing on crossing behaviour. Results showed that the phenomenon is characterised by three main phases: approaching, appraising (evaluation of the distance and speed of oncoming vehicles) and crossing. The final objective of the research is to support the development of a microscopic agent-based tool for simulating pedestrian behaviour at unsignalized crosswalks, focusing on the specific needs of the elderly pedestrians.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s). Published by Taylor {\&} Francis. This paper presents a feedback-feedforward steering controller that simultaneously maintains vehicle stability at the limits of handling while minimising lateral path tracking deviation. The design begins by considering the performance of a baseline controller with a lookahead feedback scheme and a feedforward algorithm based on a nonlinear vehicle handling diagram. While this initial design exhibits desirable stability properties at the limits of handling, the steady-state path deviation increases significantly at highway speeds. Results from both linear and nonlinear analyses indicate that lateral path tracking deviations are minimised when vehicle sideslip is held tangent to the desired path at all times. Analytical results show that directly incorporating this sideslip tangency condition into the steering feedback dramatically improves lateral path tracking, but at the expense of poor closed-loop stability margins. However, incorporating the desired sideslip behaviour into the feedforward loop creates a robust steering controller capable of accurate path tracking and oversteer correction at the physical limits of tyre friction. Experimental data collected from an Audi TTS test vehicle driving at the handling limits on a full length race circuit demonstrates the improved performance of the final controller design.},

abstract = {Future vehicle systems for active pedestrian safety will not only require a high recognition performance but also an accurate analysis of the developing traffic situation. In this paper, we present a study on pedestrian path prediction and action classification at short subsecond time intervals. We consider four representative approaches: two novel approaches (based on Gaussian process dynamical models and probabilistic hierarchical trajectory matching) that use augmented features derived from dense optical flow and two approaches as baseline that use positional information only (a Kalman filter and its extension to interacting multiple models). In experiments using stereo vision data obtained from a vehicle, we investigate the accuracy of path prediction and action classification at various time horizons, the effect of various errors (image localization, vehicle egomotion estimation), and the benefit of the proposed approaches. The scenario of interest is that of a crossing pedestrian, who might stop or continue walking at the road curbside. Results indicate similar performance of the four approaches on walking motion, with near-linear dynamics. During stopping, however, the two newly proposed approaches, with nonlinear and/or higher order models and augmented motion features, achieve a more accurate position prediction of 10–50 cm at a time horizon of 0–0.77 s around the stopping event.},

This paper addresses this problem and presents an approach for set-based predictions of pedestrians using reachability analysis. We obtain tight over-approximations of pedestrians' reachable occupancy by incorporating the dynamics of pedestrians, contextual information, and traffic rules. In addition, since pedestrians often disregard traffic rules, our constraints automatically adapt so that such behaviors are included in the prediction. Using datasets of recorded pedestrians, we validate our proposed method and demonstrate its use for evasive maneuver planning of automated vehicles.},

abstract = {This study analyzes vehicle-pedestrian crashes at intersections in Florida over 4 years, 1999-2002. The study identifies the group of drivers and pedestrians, and traffic and environmental characteristics that are correlated with high pedestrian crashes using log-linear models. The study also estimates the likelihood of pedestrian injury severity when pedestrians are involved in crashes using an ordered probit model. To better reflect pedestrian crash risk, a logical measure of exposure is developed using the information on individual walking trips in the household travel survey. Lastly, the impact of average traffic volume on pedestrian crashes is examined. As a result of the analysis, it was found that pedestrian and driver demographic factors, and road geometric, traffic and environment conditions are closely related to the frequency and injury severity of pedestrian crashes. Higher average traffic volume at intersections increases the number of pedestrian crashes; however, the rate of increase is steeper at lower values of average traffic volume.

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular technology for studying social cognition. In particular, fNIRS permits simultaneous measurement of hemodynamic activity in two or more individuals interacting in a naturalistic setting. Here, we used fNIRS hyperscanning to study social cognition and communication in human dyads engaged in cooperative and non-cooperative interaction while they played the game of Jenga™. Novel methods were developed to identify synchronized channels for each dyad and a structural node-based spatial registration approach was utilized for inter-dyad analyses. Strong inter-brain neural synchrony (INS) was observed in the posterior region of the right middle and superior frontal gyrus, in particular Brodmann area 8, during cooperative and obstructive interaction. This synchrony was not observed during the parallel game play condition and the dialogue section, suggesting that BA8 was involved in goal-oriented social interaction such as complex interactive movements and social decision-making. INS was also observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal region (dmPFC), in particular Brodmann 9, during cooperative interaction only. These additional findings suggest that BA9 may be particularly engaged when theory-of-mind is required for cooperative social interaction. The new methods described here have the potential to significantly extend fNIRS applications to social cognitive research.},

abstract = {When pedestrians encounter vehicles, they typically stop and wait for a signal from the driver to either cross or wait. What happens when the car is autonomous and there isn't a human driver to signal them? This paper seeks to address this issue with an intent communication system (ICS) that acts in place of a human driver. This intent system has been developed to take into account the psychology behind what pedestrians are familiar with and what they expect from machines. The system integrates those expectations into the design of physical systems and mathematical algorithms. The goal of the system is to ensure that communication is simple, yet effective without leaving pedestrians with a sense of distrust in autonomous vehicles. To validate the ICS, two types of experiments have been run: field tests with an autonomous vehicle to determine how humans actually interact with the ICS and simulations to account for multiple potential behaviors.The results from both experiments show that humans react positively and more predictably when the intent of the vehicle is communicated compared to when the intent of the vehicle is unknown. In particular, the results from the simulation specifically showed a 142 percent difference between the pedestrian's trust in the vehicle's actions when the ICS is enabled and the pedestrian has prior knowledge of the vehicle than when the ICS is not enabled and the pedestrian having no prior knowledge of the vehicle.},

Pedestrian interaction with motor vehicles is found to be one of the major constraints to pedestrians' during road crossing. Traffic accidents involving pedestrians are a major safety problem throughout the world. The objective of this study is to investigate pedestrians' gap acceptance behaviour at mid block street crossings in urban arterial roads. In this study the size of vehicular gaps accepted by pedestrians and the decision making processes are mainly examined. For this purpose a suitable mid block section was selected in Hyderabad. Video graphic survey was conducted to collect pedestrians' characteristics, vehicular characteristics and flow characteristics. Pedestrian gap acceptance behavioral model was developed using regression technique. The study result shows that pedestrians' gap acceptance is better explained by the following variable attempts - pedestrian speed condition during crossing, crossing direction, rolling gap, vehicle speed and pedestrian age. The rolling gap plays a main role in pedestrians' decision making process.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges that autonomous cars are facing today is driving in urban environments. To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between the vehicles and pedestrians as the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, etc. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior, and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions.},

@article{Schmidt2009,
abstract = {Aim of the presented research is the development of a cognitive driver assistance system, which can capture the traffic situation, analyse it, and warn the driver in case a pedestrian is a potential hazard. Hence parameters have to be identified by which the intention of the pedestrian can be unambiguously predicted. Two approaches to the topic are addressed. First, the pedestrian's perspective was taken. The question was how crossing decisions were influenced by the parameters distance and velocity of the car. Following a signal, participants had to choose to cross the road in front of or behind the car. The data analysis showed that pedestrians relied on the distance of the car rather than the time to collision for their decision. In the second experiment the observer's perspective raised the question what parameters humans use to predict pedestrians' intentions. Videos of natural traffic scenes were presented. Participants had to make statements about whether the shown pedestrian would cross the street during the next moment. In a baseline and four experimental conditions, certain information was masked in the videos. Just the condition in which only the trajectory information of the pedestrian was available produced a higher error rate. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {This research explores factors associated with driver yielding behavior at unsignalized pedestrian crossings and develops predictive models for yielding by using logistic regression. It considers the effect of variables describing driver attributes, pedestrian characteristics, and concurrent conditions at the crosswalk on yield response. Special consideration is given to "vehicle dynamics constraints" that form a threshold for the potential to yield. Similarities to driver reaction in response to the amber indication at a signalized intersection are identified. The logit models were developed from data collected at two unsignalized midblock crosswalks in North Carolina. The data include before and after observations of two pedestrian safety treatments, an in-street pedestrian crossing sign and pedestrian-actuated in-roadway warning lights. The analysis suggests that drivers are more likely to yield to assertive pedestrians who walk briskly in their approach to the crosswalk. In turn, the yield probability is reduced with higher speeds, with deceleration rates, and if vehicles are traveling in platoons. The treatment effects proved to be significant and increased the propensity of drivers to yield, but their effectiveness may be dependent on whether the pedestrian activates the treatment. The results of this research provide new insights into the complex interaction of pedestrians and vehicles at unsignalized intersections and have implications for future work toward predictive models for driver yielding behavior. The developed logit models can provide the basis for representing driver yielding behavior in a microsimulation modeling environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

@article{Sun2002,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop realistic models for pedestrian motorist interaction at an uncontrolled two-lane mid-block crosswalk. Two different phenomena are studied for the motorist-pedestrian interaction: the attributes which pedestrians consider in accepting gaps and the attributes in motorist yield behavior. Different methodologies for modeling Pedestrian Gap Acceptance (PGA) and the Motorist Yield (MOY) are proposed. For the PGA, the first model is deterministic and solely depends on the gap sizes that are accepted or rejected by pedestrians. The second model is probabilistic and the probability of accepting a gap is calculated as a random variable from a distribution that best fits the data. The third model uses a binary logit approach; multi-attribute regression analyses are performed to capture the decision making process of the pedestrian. Two models are proposed to capture the MOY behavior: a discrete probability model and a MOY binary logit model. These models are integrated using a System Dynamic Interaction (SDI) which shows the inter-dependency of both the PGA and MOY models and gives the final decision making of the system. Further, an intuition is also given by the SDI model for building a simulation framework for modeling these interactions. A field study was conducted to collect the data of different attributes using a set of video cameras at a typical unsignalized mid-block crosswalk. This data was used to calibrate and validate the different proposed models. The results show that PGA and MOY binary logit models perform better than the other models. Moreover, additional insights are provided into the PGA and MOY behavior based on the data.},

abstract = {This research aims to investigate pedestrians traffic gap acceptance for mid-block street crossing in urban areas. In particular, two aspects of pedestrians crossing behaviour at mid- block locations are examined, namely the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians and the decision or not to cross the street, as well as the related determinants. For this purpose, a field survey was carried out at an uncontrolled mid-block location in the centre of Athens, Greece. In this survey, pedestrians crossing decisions were videotaped in real traffic conditions. At the same time, the speed of incoming vehicles was measured by means of speed guns. The data collected included the number and the size of traffic gaps rejected or accepted by pedestrians, the related waiting times and number of crossing attempts, the vehicle's speed, as well as individual characteristics (gender, age etc.). A lognormal regression model was then developed in order to examine the effect of various parameters on pedestrian gap acceptance, defined as the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians. It was found that pedestrian's gap acceptance was better explained by the distance from the incoming vehicle, rather than its speed. Moreover, the presence of illegally parked vehicles (which may affect pedestrians' visibility), the size of the incoming vehicle and the presence of other pedestrians were found to have important effect on the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians. A binary logistic model was also developed in order to examine the effect of the traffic gaps available and of other parameters on the decision of pedestrians to cross the street or not. The modeling results reveal that this type of crossing decision is largely defined by the distance from the incoming vehicles and the waiting time of pedestrians.},
