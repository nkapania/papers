TODO: 

*Eq. (4) and (5) seemed disconnected from eachother and
also the preceding text. What is \alpha in (4)? Is it
\alpha_r and \alpha_f stacked into a vector? Please take
care in clarifying these and also other modeling equations
for better readability. I had trouble following these.

*Section II.B paragraph 1: The statement is wrong.
Nonlinear systems are actively studied in ILC, perhaps even
more so than linear systems. Please correct this. 

The phrase "The monotonic..." after (2) is wrong. This is
only true in the more specific case e_{\infty}=0, which in
general requires Q=I. It is possible in ILC design to
choose filters that amplify the error, roughly similar to
the case that in LTI systems the state feedback gain K can
deteriorate the DC gain performance. Please also correct
the phrase right after (18). Condition (19) is used in
general to prevent large ILC transients, see Bristow et al.
survey paper.

(16) and (22) are disconnected. (22) should be for the
more general update law u_{k+1}=Qu_k+Le_k as opposed to the
more special case u_{k+1}=Q(u_k+Le_k) given in (16). (22b)
should also be corrected to as (P^TTP+R+S)^{-1}P^TT ; I
believe there are some typos and errors in ref. [13]. Refer
to this conference paper, again by Bristow:

*The phrase "However, a disadvantage is that..." is wrong.
The learning filters are iteration invariant. What the
authors mean is that the input is recalculated each
iteration by matrix multiplication via (16), which is
computationally expensive (O(n2)) save for simpler
algorithms like proportional control, which is O(n). Please
correct and clarify.

*In the conclusion the phrase "While representing the
vehicle dynamics.." is not clear. The two approaches
sound the same to me.

*Equations not referred to in the body of the text should
not be numbered.

*you use \kappa(s) in section II.A. Seeing that the
independent variable s is not used anywhere else and could
be confusing I suggest simplifying it to \kappa.

*Not sure if this is vehicle dynamics convention but
perhaps you can replace the yaw rate r with another symbol;
r is often used as reference in control so I was confused
at first.  


Figure 2 leaves gaps in one's understanding:
 a. x_la has to be guessed (while e and e_la are relatively
clear).
 b. The \beta (and even r) described in (3) aren't shown in
Figure 2. Any method of displaying these in Figure 2 would
add value to the illustration.
 c. The direction of vectors F_y and U_y (though having the
same geometric subscript) appears to be different.

 Despite separate lateral forces F_yf and F_yr in (3),
the formula (4) explains a (common ?) F_y and uses a common
\alpha. Neither have support in Figure 2. One assumes that
other than demonstrating the non-linear nature of F_y there
is no other point that is missed.

The subscript c in (7) is a bit distracting. One assumes
it is for 'control'. But since it is eventually avoided
anyway (e.g. (12)), that could be done early.

Are the C_F used in (9) the same as C_f used in (8) ?
Similarly, are the U_X used in (5), (8) same as U_x used in
(3) ?

5. The \kappa in (11) appears to be unexplained.


The subscript L in (16) should be superscript as in
(14a), it appears.

 When Figure 3 is described, it is said that a low-pass
filter improves ILC performance. Can the authors refer to
any work where such a filter (on ILC output) is used ?

8. Kindly write as "insufficient for controller design".

 They should comment more on whether or not this approach
is applicable in a more general setting, when one is
dealing with a generic autonomous vehicle and not a racing
car.

How do you determine if the car is operating near the
limits of its handling ? 

It is a bit confusing that the condition for
monotonic convergence (19) is included in the section on
proportional-derivative controllers, while it is a general
result for ILC and can therefore be included in the
introduction of Section III.

Include some comments about the design of
T,R, and S for this specific application. The statements
are rather general in the manuscript.
