abstract = {Walking is one of the main transport mode and more sustainable to human society. Pedestrian interaction with motor vehicles is found to be one of the major constraints to pedestrians' during road crossing. Traffic accidents involving pedestrians are a major safety problem throughout the world. The objective of this study is to investigate pedestrians' gap acceptance behaviour at mid block street crossings in urban arterial roads. In this study the size of vehicular gaps accepted by pedestrians and the decision making processes are mainly examined. For this purpose a suitable mid block section was selected in Hyderabad. Video graphic survey was conducted to collect pedestrians' characteristics, vehicular characteristics and flow characteristics. Pedestrian gap acceptance behavioral model was developed using regression technique. The study result shows that pedestrians' gap acceptance is better explained by the following variable attempts - pedestrian speed condition during crossing, crossing direction, rolling gap, vehicle speed and pedestrian age. The rolling gap plays a main role in pedestrians' decision making process.},

Pedestrians who encountered the car reported that they saw no driver, yet they managed interactions smoothly, except when the car misbehaved by moving into the crosswalk just as they were about to cross. This method is the first of its kind, and we believe that it contributes a valuable technique for safely acquiring empirical data and insights about driverless vehicle interactions. These insights can then be used to design vehicle behaviors well in advance of the broad deployment of autonomous technology.},

abstract = {This research aims to investigate pedestrians traffic gap acceptance for mid-block street crossing in urban areas. In particular, two aspects of pedestrians crossing behaviour at mid- block locations are examined, namely the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians and the decision or not to cross the street, as well as the related determinants. For this purpose, a field survey was carried out at an uncontrolled mid-block location in the centre of Athens, Greece. In this survey, pedestrians crossing decisions were videotaped in real traffic conditions. At the same time, the speed of incoming vehicles was measured by means of speed guns. The data collected included the number and the size of traffic gaps rejected or accepted by pedestrians, the related waiting times and number of crossing attempts, the vehicle's speed, as well as individual characteristics (gender, age etc.). A lognormal regression model was then developed in order to examine the effect of various parameters on pedestrian gap acceptance, defined as the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians. It was found that pedestrian's gap acceptance was better explained by the distance from the incoming vehicle, rather than its speed. Moreover, the presence of illegally parked vehicles (which may affect pedestrians' visibility), the size of the incoming vehicle and the presence of other pedestrians were found to have important effect on the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians. A binary logistic model was also developed in order to examine the effect of the traffic gaps available and of other parameters on the decision of pedestrians to cross the street or not. The modeling results reveal that this type of crossing decision is largely defined by the distance from the incoming vehicles and the waiting time of pedestrians.},

abstract = {This study analyzes vehicle-pedestrian crashes at intersections in Florida over 4 years, 1999-2002. The study identifies the group of drivers and pedestrians, and traffic and environmental characteristics that are correlated with high pedestrian crashes using log-linear models. The study also estimates the likelihood of pedestrian injury severity when pedestrians are involved in crashes using an ordered probit model. To better reflect pedestrian crash risk, a logical measure of exposure is developed using the information on individual walking trips in the household travel survey. Lastly, the impact of average traffic volume on pedestrian crashes is examined. As a result of the analysis, it was found that pedestrian and driver demographic factors, and road geometric, traffic and environment conditions are closely related to the frequency and injury severity of pedestrian crashes. Higher average traffic volume at intersections increases the number of pedestrian crashes; however, the rate of increase is steeper at lower values of average traffic volume. Based on the findings in the analysis, some countermeasures are recommended to improve pedestrian safety. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop realistic models for pedestrian motorist interaction at an uncontrolled two-lane mid-block crosswalk. Two different phenomena are studied for the motorist-pedestrian interaction: the attributes which pedestrians consider in accepting gaps and the attributes in motorist yield behavior. Different methodologies for modeling Pedestrian Gap Acceptance (PGA) and the Motorist Yield (MOY) are proposed. For the PGA, the first model is deterministic and solely depends on the gap sizes that are accepted or rejected by pedestrians. The second model is probabilistic and the probability of accepting a gap is calculated as a random variable from a distribution that best fits the data. The third model uses a binary logit approach; multi-attribute regression analyses are performed to capture the decision making process of the pedestrian. Two models are proposed to capture the MOY behavior: a discrete probability model and a MOY binary logit model. These models are integrated using a System Dynamic Interaction (SDI) which shows the inter-dependency of both the PGA and MOY models and gives the final decision making of the system. Further, an intuition is also given by the SDI model for building a simulation framework for modeling these interactions. A field study was conducted to collect the data of different attributes using a set of video cameras at a typical unsignalized mid-block crosswalk. This data was used to calibrate and validate the different proposed models. The results show that PGA and MOY binary logit models perform better than the other models. Moreover, additional insights are provided into the PGA and MOY behavior based on the data.},

abstract = {This research explores factors associated with driver yielding behavior at unsignalized pedestrian crossings and develops predictive models for yielding by using logistic regression. It considers the effect of variables describing driver attributes, pedestrian characteristics, and concurrent conditions at the crosswalk on yield response. Special consideration is given to "vehicle dynamics constraints" that form a threshold for the potential to yield. Similarities to driver reaction in response to the amber indication at a signalized intersection are identified. The logit models were developed from data collected at two unsignalized midblock crosswalks in North Carolina. The data include before and after observations of two pedestrian safety treatments, an in-street pedestrian crossing sign and pedestrian-actuated in-roadway warning lights. The analysis suggests that drivers are more likely to yield to assertive pedestrians who walk briskly in their approach to the crosswalk. In turn, the yield probability is reduced with higher speeds, with deceleration rates, and if vehicles are traveling in platoons. The treatment effects proved to be significant and increased the propensity of drivers to yield, but their effectiveness may be dependent on whether the pedestrian activates the treatment. The results of this research provide new insights into the complex interaction of pedestrians and vehicles at unsignalized intersections and have implications for future work toward predictive models for driver yielding behavior. The developed logit models can provide the basis for representing driver yielding behavior in a microsimulation modeling environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},
